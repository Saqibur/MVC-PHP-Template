# MVC-PHP Template from Scratch

### Note to self: Make sure you change the 'RewriteBase /MVC-PHP-Template/public' for your project in .htaccess

## If you are reading this part of the README, you shouldn't be looking so far behind in the commit history, it's embarassing.

# What This Project Is
- A simple 'nano'-framework for building MVC web applications.
- I use the term build loosely because outside of a classroom/learning environment everything about this project breaks down.
- By going through all the grunt work of building your own MVC-app from the groundup, you will be able to learn a lot about how better, bigger, and *actual* frameworks... well, work.
- Build and test your CRUD apps quickly while learning MVC.
- Aimed at those who are just picking up PHP and want to work on a simple project.

# What This Project Is Not
- A solid framework to build web applications.
- A proper introduction to MVC, PHP or Web Development Frameworks.
- Secure
- Reliable
- Pliable
- A solution to your problems. PHP is horrible to code in so it's best to just keep away.
