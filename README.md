# Simple-MVC-PHP-Template

## What This Project Is
- A light-weight template for building basic MVC web applications.
- Can be used to make classroom projects/prototypes.
- Solidy MVC concepts without hand-holding all the way through.
- Build and test CRUD apps quickly while maintaining an MVC structure.

## What This Project Is Not
- A solid framework to build web applications. This is just a template and is not pretending to be a framework.
- A proper introduction to MVC, PHP or Web development frameworks like Laravel/Code Igniter.
- Secure
- Reliable
- A solution to life's problems.
